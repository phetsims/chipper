/**
 * launch point to load any tests located around the chipper repo. This is to support running `qunit` with no args
 * from the top level of chipper, as is the recommended way to run chipper tests.
 *
 * On May 12, 2021, @samreid ran tests like so:
 * npm install --save-dev qunit
 * node node_modules/qunit/bin/qunit.js test/generalTests.js
 *
 * I didn't use a global qunit, since it seems we will eventually need a way to version qunit with chipper.
