# Chipper Scripts

This directory is a place for scripts that are related to the building of sims. If you are here, it is quite likely that
you actually want to put your script in perennial, which is for scripts that don't have anything to do with building a
simulation. While you're at it, please also ask yourself if this script should be part of the stable API for chipper,
meaning that it should be a grunt task instead of a script. See details about how we organize our built tool code in
https://github.com/phetsims/perennial/issues/370.
