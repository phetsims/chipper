/**
 * This files demonstrates the pattern for a repo that has both browser and NodeJS code in it.
 *
 * NOTE: we do not extend tsconfig-core.json. This is a composite just for referencing the individual typescript
 * sub-projects within this repo.
 *
 * NOTE: By default, TypeScript includes all files below the tsconfig.json location. However, we must override that to
 * blank it out, so that we can let each browser/node decide what they want to include.
 *
 * NOTE: We do not need to set "composite": true here because TypeScript is smart enough to recognize that setting with
 * "references" set and an empty list of "files".
